\section overview Overview

\image html grvy-small.png

The GRVY Toolkit is a library used to house various support
functions often required for application development of
high-performance, scientific applications.  The library is written in
C++, but provides an API for development in C and Fortran.  The
primary functionality provided by the library is categorized as
follows:

<ul>
<li>a flexible method for
parsing keyword driven input files (with backwards-compatibility support)
<li>a performance timing mechanism to provide a simple
summary of individual code section performance along with basic
statistics
<li> an HDF5 based historical performance mechanism for logging 
application performance over time on various compute resources
<li> a simple priority-based logging mechanism to control application messages
<li> utilities for offloading out-of-core read/write operations to a
pool of distributed shared-memory nodes using MPI for data transfer
<li> miscellaneous file handling and math utilities
</ul>

To aid in usage, this document is
further divided into the following subsections:

/*! \page inputFile Example libGRVY Input File

This is an example input file for use with the libGRVY parsing mechanism.
Note that behind the scenes, the library is using
the <a href="http://getpot.sourceforge.net/">GetPot</a> parsing tool
to provide a flexible parsing mechanism for C/C++ and Fortran.  Note
that the default comment delimiter is defined as the \# sign and
comments can begin at the beginning of a line or after a variable
declaration to aid in documenting the input file.  The parsing
mechansism is keyword driven and can be organized into multiple
sections.  Consequently, you are allowed to have variables of the same
name so long as they are within unique section definitions.  Note also
that because the parsing mechanism is keyword driven, the input
directives can be specified in \e arbitrary order.  There is no
requirement to maintain a specific variable declaration pattern.

<b>Important Note for Fortran Programmers</b> The input parser can
handle double precision input using standard C style notation;
however, it will not support Fortran's "d" delimiter. So, please specify
double precision values as \e 1.2345e6 as opposed to \e 1.2345d6.

/*! \page installation Installation and Linkage

libGRVY uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users. The three basic steps of the autotools process are:

- \ref Configuration
- \ref Build
- \ref Installation  

These installation steps are discussed in more detail below followed
by information on how to \ref Linkage "link" against the library once installed.  To
initiate the build process starting from a release distribution, you
should first untar the distribution and enter the top-level directory:

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
\> tar xvfz grvy-$(VERSION).tar.gz
\> cd grvy-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<b>External Software Dependencies:</b>

\li <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost C++ library </a>  -> \b required
\li <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5 library</a> -> \em optional
\li MPI library (e.g. <a href="http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/overview/mvapich2/"> MVAPICH2</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/"> OpenMPI</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/"> MPICH2</a>)  -> \em optional

The minimum software required to build libGRVY is a local copy of the
Boost library. Note that you can choose to build libGRVY against a \a
header-only version of Boost or a full library installation. A build
using the header-only version will disable some miscellaneous libGRVY
functionality which leverages Boost libraries (grvy_copy_dir(), in
particular).  Additional library functionality can be enabled via
linkage to optional HDF and MPI libraries.

<hr>

\anchor Configuration <h2>Configuration </h2> 

If Boost is installed and available within your default login
environment, then libGRVY should automatically configure against the
available installation.  If, however, your Boost installation is in a
non-standard location, use the \c "--with-boost" option to specify
the location.

Since libGRVY provides a Fortran interface, a valid Fortran90 compiler
is also required.  To date, libGRVY has been successfully tested with
\e gfortran and the Intel \e ifort compilers.  The configuration step
will look for available compilers in the user environment but as with
any \e autoconf based configuration, these can be overridden with
command line arguments (by setting \c CXX, \c CC, and \c FC
appropriately).  For full documentation on available configuration
options, run \c "configure --help".  The examples below highlight
common configuration examples:

<em>Configure with Boost from default login environment (and request
installation in user's ~/bin/grvy directory):</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy \endcode

<em>Or, configure with Boost from a specific directory:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy --with-boost=$MY_BOOST_DIR/boost-1.37.0 \endcode

<em>Or, configure with specific Intel compilers:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure CXX=icpc CC=icc FC=ifort --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy \endcode

<em>Or, configure for Boost header-only compilation:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy --enable-boost-headers-only\endcode

<em>Or, enable optional functionality requiring MPI:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy --enable-mpi\endcode

<em>Or, enable optional functionality requiring HDF5:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy --with-hdf5=$MY_HDF5_DIR/bin/hdf5-1.8.4\endcode

\anchor Build <h2> Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a \c "make" to build the software. If successful, this
will build the libGRVY library (static and dynamic versions) along with relevant binaries and several
examples.

\code > make \endcode

<b> Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working
properly, a test option is provided to run a short suite of
functionality tests against the local build.  To run, issue a \c "make
check" to initiate the tests.  If successful, output similar to the
following will be generated (the exact number of tests will vary depending on
version and configuration options):

\code

\anchor Installation <h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a \c "make install" to install
the library.  The installation will consist of four top-level
directories housing the library, binaries, include files, and
example files.  An example of the top-level directories after
installation is shown below:

\code > make install \endcode

Top-level libGRVY installation directory:

\code
 > ls $HOME/bin/grvy/
 bin/ examples/  include/  lib/
\endcode


\anchor Linkage <h2>Library Linkage</h2>

To link an external C/C++ or Fortran application with an installed
version of the library, the \c include directory must be added to the
compilers include search path in order to access the grvy.h header
file (or for Fortran, the \c lib directory should be added to access
the pre-compiled grvy F90 module).  The \c lib directory should also
be added to the linker search path along with a request to link
against the libGRVY library (and the Fortran interface for F90
applications).  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the libGRVY library has been successfully built
and installed previously in the users's ~/bin/grvy directory:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode

<h3>Fortran Example</h3>

\code > $(FC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/lib app.f90 -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy -lgrvyf \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the libGRVY library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

<h3>C/C++ Example (with embedded rpath)</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode


<b>Important Note:</b> F90 module file formats are not consistent
across multiple compilers. Therefore, a Fortran application and the libGRVY
F90 interface \em must be built with the same Fortran compiler family to ensure
compatibility.
